### {{ site.name }}

Hi, my name is Lucas Amorim and I'm a penetration tester/backend software developer in Vancouver, Canada.

My interest in computers started in 2003, when I was 15 years old and I found [Linux][conectiva] for the first time.

I started my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science in 2007.  That same year I also began my first job in IT as a sysadmin/security analyst and released my first open source tool: [gtool][gtool].
